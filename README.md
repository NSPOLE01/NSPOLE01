# Hi there I'm Nikhil Polepalli! 👋🏽


## About Me 📝
I'm a Vanderbilt Grad with a dual degree in Computer Science and Economics. Currently, I am a Software Engineer at Capital One where I work on maintaining and building critical database infrastructure. As a certified AWS solutions architect, I have a strong foundational knowledge of cloud services and have deployed several microarchitecture services independently. While most of my repos are private for personal reasons, I hope my public repositories help highlight my past experiences and demonstrate my talent as a software engineer!
